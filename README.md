# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.

In the competitive aviation industry, customer satisfaction plays a vital role in shaping the reputation and success of an airline. Kenya Airways, like many airlines, receives numerous reviews from passengers, which contain valuable feedback about their experiences. Understanding the sentiments behind these reviews is essential for identifying strengths and weaknesses in service delivery. This project will leverage sentiment analysis to process and analyze customer feedback, enabling Kenya Airways to make informed decisions that enhance passenger satisfaction and loyalty.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT.

Kenya Airways is challenged by the vast amount of unstructured customer feedback available through online reviews. Without an efficient method to analyze this feedback, the airline may overlook critical insights that could lead to service improvements. This project aims to address this challenge by systematically analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews, providing Kenya Airways with a clear understanding of customer perceptions and identifying key areas that require attention.

# VISUALIZATIONS 

![Distribution_of_Ratings]](image-2.png)
A majority of ratings cluster around the higher end of the scale, with 4.0 and 5.0 being the most frequent. This indicated a positive bias in the dataset, as lower ratings are significantly less common. Such a distribution might suggest high overall customer satisfaction or potential rating inflation.
